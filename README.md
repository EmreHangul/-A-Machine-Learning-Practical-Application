# -A-Machine-Learning-Practical-Application
A practical application on students' degrees dataset using several supervised and unsupervised learning techniques

* The dataset contains students' grades from 3 different Indian colleges (131 instances of 22 features).

* The software WEKA is used to apply different supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. These include K- Nearest Neighbor, Rule Induction, Support Vector Machines, Classification Trees, Artificial Neural Networks, Partitional Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering etc.

* Several feature subsetting techniques are also used such as univariate & multivariate filters (information gain, correlation based etc.) and wrappers (best first, greedy stepwise etc.)

* Results that prove the associations and possible groupings of the features are shown both numerically and graphically.
